You can shoot 720p video at 480fps as well as 4K 60fps (limited to 5 minutes at a stretch) and the inclusion of pro mode makes it easier to tweak the camera according to your needs.

It's plenty fast despite being a first-generation in-screen reader however still slower than physical button readers as well as the native face unlock (which is really really good and insanely fast even in low light) If you're someone who disables face unlock and will only use your fingerprint then it is good enough for your daily needs.\n",

The speaker despite being a mono downward firing one is loud enough to play music and answer calls from far away. One issue I have with the bottom speaker is that despite being two grills, one on either side of the type C slot, there is only one speaker which is the left one which means if you cover it you will muffle 90% of the sound also by looking at the pictures you might assume it might be dual bottom firing speakers but it's only one (so it might seem like false advertising?) but still it doesn't affect the quality or the loudness of the sound one bit so I may be nitpicking here. A lack of headphone jack means you have to settle for bt audio or use the dongle provided by oneplus for free in the box. Since I am coming from an LG G6 which had a 32-bit Quad DAC it is a big letdown since USB-C audio is still garbage and wireless music still cannot compete in quality with wired.\n",

You can shoot 720p video at 480fps as well as 4K 60fps (limited to 5 minutes at a stretch) and the inclusion of pro mode makes it easier to tweak the camera according to your needs.

It's plenty fast despite being a first-generation in-screen reader however still slower than physical button readers as well as the native face unlock (which is really really good and insanely fast even in low light) If you're someone who disables face unlock and will only use your fingerprint then it is good enough for your daily needs.\n",

The speaker despite being a mono downward firing one is loud enough to play music and answer calls from far away. One issue I have with the bottom speaker is that despite being two grills, one on either side of the type C slot, there is only one speaker which is the left one which means if you cover it you will muffle 90% of the sound also by looking at the pictures you might assume it might be dual bottom firing speakers but it's only one (so it might seem like false advertising?) but still it doesn't affect the quality or the loudness of the sound one bit so I may be nitpicking here. A lack of headphone jack means you have to settle for bt audio or use the dongle provided by oneplus for free in the box. Since I am coming from an LG G6 which had a 32-bit Quad DAC it is a big letdown since USB-C audio is still garbage and wireless music still cannot compete in quality with wired.\n",

You can shoot 720p video at 480fps as well as 4K 60fps (limited to 5 minutes at a stretch) and the inclusion of pro mode makes it easier to tweak the camera according to your needs. The front camera is crisp and an improvement over its predecessor. While it may not be as exceptional as the Pixel 3 or Note 9, it is still the best camera in its price range.\n",

In my short use of the phone so far I've consistently got 4.5-5 hours SoT and the standby time is insane as well. This is one of the best phones battery management wise bar the Note 9.\n",

While it definitely is not gimmicky, it is not completely useful as well. It's plenty fast despite being a first-generation in-screen reader however still slower than physical button readers as well as the native face unlock (which is really really good and insanely fast even in low light) If you're someone who disables face unlock and will only use your fingerprint then it is good enough for your daily needs.\n",

      "                    Sound 7/10: Due to the reduced notch, the earpiece is shifted into the top slit however it is still plenty audible and really clear. The speaker despite being a mono downward firing one is loud enough to play music and answer calls from far away. One issue I have with the bottom speaker is that despite being two grills, one on either side of the type C slot, there is only one speaker which is the left one which means if you cover it you will muffle 90% of the sound also by looking at the pictures you might assume it might be dual bottom firing speakers but it's only one (so it might seem like false advertising?) but still it doesn't affect the quality or the loudness of the sound one bit so I may be nitpicking here. A lack of headphone jack means you have to settle for bt audio or use the dongle provided by oneplus for free in the box. Since I am coming from an LG G6 which had a 32-bit Quad DAC it is a big letdown since USB-C audio is still garbage and wireless music still cannot compete in quality with wired.\n",

The hardware is not much different from the OP6 but in a blind camera test, the T took slightly better low light images with the 6 blowing off highlights more. It could be an issue with that one device but suffice to say the camera is awesome and very capable unless you go comparing with the Pixel 3. I was literally blown from the result of clicking a really, really dark scene and it still had magically squeezed in almost natural light in the picture - just don't expect to create a 10x10 photo frame and you'll be fine. In regular night scenes with some ambient light, there isn't much difference between Auto and night mode. Photography under normal light condition is good - adequately sharp, not overtly saturated and we'll detailed. I find the white balance slightly off but can be fixed in \"pro\" settings. At times, the highlight gets blown out but that's okay for a phone at this price point and I believe many of the camera shortcomings can be fixed with a software upgrade. I would have preferred a wide-angle camera over the depth camera - mind you, the depth camera too works brilliantly in portrait mode and gives you a more natural bokeh effect than software enhanced background blur\n",

The matte Midnight Black model I tested is a subtle standout in a sea of glassy black 6-inch slabs (i.e., almost every other Android flagship). The glossy Mirror Black shade is more run-of-the-mill. Unfortunately, OnePlus isn't releasing a Silk White variant of the 6T, at least not yet. The pearly finish of that OnePlus 6 model was one-of-a-kind. The Mirror and Midnight Black hues are standard for OnePlus, so it would be nice to see a fresh shade for the  6T.OnePlus has slightly refined its go-to aesthetic for the 6T with tweaks like a teardrop-shaped notch, which is significantly smaller than the iPhone X-style notch at the top of the OnePlus 6's display. The 6T's bottom bezel is also a smidge thinner than its predecessor's. But the overall dimensions have remained largely the same over the years, even as display size has increased and the fingerprint sensor has moved from chin to back to beneath the display.\n",

Notch is unobtrusive and looks cool, and hiding option available. Night mode is a good thought. I don't have to download an extra app. (My 1st time with an OnePlus and I'm happy about the handy features it comes with, if some features I'm mentioning is already there leave it).\n",

You are great at what you do, you don't have to take pricing decisions like other phonemakers, your flagship is an example for that) And also to OnePlus guys, so many fake reviews in this area.

      "                  <br/>\n",
      "                  • Performance : Overall performance is mind blowing.\n",
      "                  <br/>\n",
      "                  •Battery+Dash Charge : Battery life is just amazing and bundle it with the dash charging, u will never ever run out of power. (It makes up for no wireless charging and frankly it didnt even bother me)\n",
      "                  <br/>\n",
      "                  •Camera : Camera quality is superb, use it with pixels camera port and it can challenge any smartphone anyday. I have added one photo which i shot in very low light using night mode, u can check it.\n",
      "                  <br/>\n",
      "                  •Sound : Sound is also great (i have heard so many people complaining about absence of stereo speakers but i didn't notice much of a difference, it has performed upto the mark in every situation uptil now like in very noisy backgrounds)\n",
      "                  <br/>\n",
      "                  •Screen-Body Ratio : The bezels are so thin that u will fall in love with this phone if u watch videos and movies extensively on phones.\n",
      "                  <br/>\n",
      "                  •Display : The display is also very crsip and clear being fullhd+ display.\n",
      "                  <br/>\n",
      "                  •Security : Face unlock is lightning fast and u will not even see the lock screen most of the time during unlocking.\n",
      "                  <br/>\n",
      "                  •In-display fingerprint scanner is also good, not perfect as it sometimes dont recognise the finger but thats ok because with time u will get used to placing ur fingers in the required manner.\n",
      "                  <br/>\n",
      "                  •Build quality : It is very very Premium and u will feel really good while holding them in ur hands. Its design is very sleek and curvy edges makes them easy to hold.\n",

      "                   <br>\n",
      "                    • Performance : Overall performance is mind blowing.\n",
      "                    <br/>\n",
      "                    •Battery+Dash Charge : Battery life is just amazing and bundle it with the dash charging, u will never ever run out of power. (It makes up for no wireless charging and frankly it didnt even bother me)\n",
      "                    <br/>\n",
      "                    •Camera : Camera quality is superb, use it with pixels camera port and it can challenge any smartphone anyday. I have added one photo which i shot in very low light using night mode, u can check it.\n",
      "                    <br/>\n",
      "                    •Sound : Sound is also great (i have heard so many people complaining about absence of stereo speakers but i didn't notice much of a difference, it has performed upto the mark in every situation uptil now like in very noisy backgrounds)\n",
      "                    <br/>\n",
      "                    •Screen-Body Ratio : The bezels are so thin that u will fall in love with this phone if u watch videos and movies extensively on phones.\n",
      "                    <br/>\n",
      "                    •Display : The display is also very crsip and clear being fullhd+ display.\n",
      "                    <br/>\n",
      "                    •Security : Face unlock is lightning fast and u will not even see the lock screen most of the time during unlocking.\n",
      "                    <br/>\n",
      "                    •In-display fingerprint scanner is also good, not perfect as it sometimes dont recognise the finger but thats ok because with time u will get used to placing ur fingers in the required manner.\n",
      "                    <br/>\n",
      "                    •Build quality : It is very very Premium and u will feel really good while holding them in ur hands. Its design is very sleek and curvy edges makes them easy to hold.\n",

      "                  One of the coolest unboxing experiences. The McLaren box is very premium and the booklet starts with giving you a brief glimpse into the history of the brand and some cool pictures from the archives. It is an homage to Bruce McLaren to be honest. The Speed Mark (real Carbon Fire cutout of the McLaren logo) encased in acrylic is pretty good and can serve as a cool table top accessory or paper weight. If not for much it can be a good ice breaker for visitors to your home / office. The Charger and Cable are also customized for the McLaren edition. The Soft PU case is simple black and fits snugly. There was a missed opportunity to throw in some colour for the McLaren edition. All else is pretty much standard. Providing only a USB-C to 3.5 converter is a bummer. For the flagship offering at over 50K, throwing in a Bullet Earphone should have been standard.\n",

When you change the angle under light, it almost looks like there are LEDs inside. It looks premium for sure though an actual Carbon Fibre body would have been awesome! Be warned though that the surface is a fingerprint magnet and not easy to wipe off unless you use a good cleaning spray. The Waterdrop notch is barely noticeable and is not much of an issue. The colours are vibrant and while setting up you can choose a profile that suits your taste.\n",

I used the OnePlus switch app to transfer my apps, data and settings. The transition was hassle free and took all of 15 minutes. Most apps worked immediately but a few needed to be uninstalled and reinstalled as they were acting up. I gave it a point less as I think the OnePlus Switch app should be integrated at the setup stage instead of making a new user download it. The phone heats up considerably but it was fine after the initial 30 minutes.\n",

Probably it was due to the fact that close to 100 apps were being downloaded while it was charging. I will check the charging performance over the next few weeks and update review if required.\n",

      "                    I bought this phone by using the exchange offer with the MI Note 4 that I had used for over two years. Being a power user, high-graphics gamer, freelance graphic designer, developer, an entrepreneur &amp; a multi tasker, I find OnePlus 6T (OxygenOS) so much worth the purchase. Specially so when I am transitioning from MI Note 4 (MIUI). OnePlus 6T is an incremental upgrade to the OnePlus 6T with subtle but significant upgrades. But there is always something positive and negative about a device so following is what I feel about it:\n",

      "                    <br/>\n",
      "                    • The fingerprint scanner that was the key selling point for OnePlus 6T isnt as impressive as it seemed to be earlier before using the phone for a week. It is good but it isnt as fast as face recognition or back side fingerprint scanner. The major cause of this is that the back side fingerprint scanner in the previous model 6 was a definite point that was locatable but in 6T this area is on the screen and you need to tap the screen to get the area of fingerprint scanner to show and then you have to do the needful. This is like a step extra versus the previous models quick screen unlock with same level of security. This is a 2 second wasted only to unlock the screen.\n",

      "                    <br/>\n",
      "                    • The sound quality and camera quality is exceptionally awesome. No flaws in them for this level of pricing. There are few so called better ones in other brands but then better is a debatable word with camera output quality.\n",
      "                    <br/>\n",
      "                    <br/>\n",
      "                    • Storage / model options: I have seen the mirror version of version 6 with my friend and the midnight black that I have been using of version 6. Midnight black is just so so buttery smooth to enjoy and feel while using the phone that makes it seem like everything is on screen surface and covering the full screen area. Mirror version becomes boring and frustrating after a point because of the fingerprints that are left visible all over the back side of the body so easily everytime.\n",

      "                    • In-display fingerprint scanner / sensor: OnePlus’s dedicated fingerprint scanner has always been a secure and fastest scanner around. With in-display scanner they have integrated the fingerprint scanner inside the device remarkably well. It is fast enough to call it quick but sure isn’t as fast as dedicated scanner module which it implemented in OnePlus 6’s rear.\n",

Test it with almost any (and virtually as many) apps and 1+ 6T will deliver! Gaming Mode just adds to this beefy specs while you are gaming.\n",

      "                    • Just a Notch: It’s a huge improvement over OnePlus 6’s slab shaped huge notch. The notch in 6T is tear drop shaped and well designed, sized. It rather makes the appearance of the screen very attractive  It improves the overall usability and feel of display by many folds.\n",

      "                    • 3.5mm Audio jack is Gone: USB Type-C is all you need to charge the phone or listen to music. You need a type-C to 3.5mm audio jack/adapter within the package though which comes as a huge relief incase I am stuck with using an ordinary 3.5mm Headphones.\n",

But this also means longer charging time with the same charger as OnePlus 6 but that is okay i think since it still is fast compared to other phones. Lot of people are crying for wireless charging. I guess they dont know about the slow charging speed and longer charging time for the smartphones. Everyone who has used the fast charger knows that wireless charging is not as great as it sounds.\n",

Being a power user, high-graphics gamer, freelance graphic designer, developer, an entrepreneur &amp; a multi tasker, I find OnePlus 6T (OxygenOS) so much worth the purchase. Specially so when I am transitioning from MI Note 4 (MIUI). OnePlus 6T is an incremental upgrade to the OnePlus 6T with subtle but significant upgrades. But there is always something positive and negative about a device so following is what I feel about it:\n",

      "                    • The fingerprint scanner that was the key selling point for OnePlus 6T isnt as impressive as it seemed to be earlier before using the phone for a week. It is good but it isnt as fast as face recognition or back side fingerprint scanner. The major cause of this is that the back side fingerprint scanner in the previous model 6 was a definite point that was locatable but in 6T this area is on the screen and you need to tap the screen to get the area of fingerprint scanner to show and then you have to do the needful. This is like a step extra versus the previous models quick screen unlock with same level of security. This is a 2 second wasted only to unlock the screen.\n",

      "                    • Storage / model options: I have seen the mirror version of version 6 with my friend and the midnight black that I have been using of version 6. Midnight black is just so so buttery smooth to enjoy and feel while using the phone that makes it seem like everything is on screen surface and covering the full screen area. Mirror version becomes boring and frustrating after a point because of the fingerprints that are left visible all over the back side of the body so easily everytime.\n",

      "                    • In-display fingerprint scanner / sensor: OnePlus’s dedicated fingerprint scanner has always been a secure and fastest scanner around. With in-display scanner they have integrated the fingerprint scanner inside the device remarkably well. It is fast enough to call it quick but sure isn’t as fast as dedicated scanner module which it implemented in OnePlus 6’s rear.\n",

Test it with almost any (and virtually as many) apps and 1+ 6T will deliver! Gaming Mode just adds to this beefy specs while you are gaming.\n",

It rather makes the appearance of the screen very attractive  It improves the overall usability and feel of display by many folds.\n",

I guess they dont know about the slow charging speed and longer charging time for the smartphones.

       " <span>I'll split the review into sections to make it easy to understand.<br/><br/>Delivery 10/10: I placed the order on the 2nd since the 8/256 model was out of stock and I was supposed to receive the phone on the 4th however I was pleasantly surprised when the order shipped and was at my doorstep on the 2nd itself so kudos to the seller and Amazon for a great delivery experience.<br/><br/>Now onto the phone...<br/><br/>Build 8/10: The body of the phone is metal and the design is ergonomic. Not a huge change from the OP6 other than the lack of a fingerprint sensor. A lack of headphone jack is problematic.<br/><br/>Screen 10/10: 6.44 inch 2560x1080 AMOLED display. A gorgeous display with vivid colors and true blacks, feels better than many 2K screens and the load on the battery is reduced massively as well. The notch is improved massively as well as it feels less intrusive and easier to adopt. With an 86% screen to body ratio, the experience is immersive.<br/><br/>Internals and Software 10/10: 8GB RAM and 256GB of storage is future proof enough and can handle anything thrown at it. OxygenOS with Android Pie is greatly optimized with some useful features and the performance is fast, lag-free and snappy. SD845 is best in class and the GPU can handle heavy games with ease.<br/><br/>Camera 9/10: While it sports the same lens as its predecessor, the software tweaks and optimization makes it feel like a massive upgrade with noticeably better photos than the OP6 as well as great improvement with the Night mode in taking photos in low light. You can shoot 720p video at 480fps as well as 4K 60fps (limited to 5 minutes at a stretch) and the inclusion of pro mode makes it easier to tweak the camera according to your needs. The front camera is crisp and an improvement over its predecessor. While it may not be as exceptional as the Pixel 3 or Note 9, it is still the best camera in its price range.<br/><br/>Battery life ?/10: It's still too early to give an honest review about the battery life however the 3700mah capacity paired with the industry leading fast-charging technology makes it one of the best phone batteries. In my short use of the phone so far I've consistently got 4.5-5 hours SoT and the standby time is insane as well. This is one of the best phones battery management wise bar the Note 9.<br/><br/>New features: While the fingerprint sensor is now embedded under the screen, it is more of a positive point for the screen to body ratio than the security aspect of the phone. While it definitely is not gimmicky, it is not completely useful as well. It's plenty fast despite being a first-generation in-screen reader however still slower than physical button readers as well as the native face unlock (which is really really good and insanely fast even in low light) If you're someone who disables face unlock and will only use your fingerprint then it is good enough for your daily needs.<br/><br/>Sound 7/10: Due to the reduced notch, the earpiece is shifted into the top slit however it is still plenty audible and really clear. The speaker despite being a mono downward firing one is loud enough to play music and answer calls from far away. One issue I have with the bottom speaker is that despite being two grills, one on either side of the type C slot, there is only one speaker which is the left one which means if you cover it you will muffle 90% of the sound also by looking at the pictures you might assume it might be dual bottom firing speakers but it's only one (so it might seem like false advertising?) but still it doesn't affect the quality or the loudness of the sound one bit so I may be nitpicking here. A lack of headphone jack means you have to settle for bt audio or use the dongle provided by oneplus for free in the box. Since I am coming from an LG G6 which had a 32-bit Quad DAC it is a big letdown since USB-C audio is still garbage and wireless music still cannot compete in quality with wired.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>+Screen<br/>+Battery<br/>+Internals<br/>+Software<br/>+Camera<br/>+Phone comes with screen protector pre-applied and with a free transparent TPU case in the box so good on OP to think about the customer<br/><br/>-no 3.5mm jack<br/>-no wireless charging (not important for me)<br/><br/>BEST FLAGSHIP FOR UNDER 50K DESPITE LOSING THE HEADPHONE JACK, THE OTHER GOOD FEATURES MORE THAN MAKE UP FOR IT. GO FOR IT!!!!</span>\n",

       " <span>Never in my life I waited for a phone this bad and happy to say the wait was worth it. My LG started giving me issues just after a few months and the Samsung before that had 3 display issues in about 15 months. Tired of splurging on flagship Androids, I started looking for alternatives - the cheaper kinds, the more value for money kinds<br/><br/>OnePlus has a pretty loyal band of followers but I never appreciated the Chinese-ness of it but boy, the device is as premium as it can get. OnePlus 6 as I understood from my friends was a great device and OnePlus 6T ought to be better, right? Well, it is, objectively.<br/><br/>Call quality: Isn't that the primary purpose of any phone. Much better than the LG which was as good as unusable and slightly topping the Samsungs<br/><br/>Speaker: Reasonably loud to be useful but don't expect it to win sound quality awards. My LG with DAC stands defeated when I use it with my earphones and headphones. My Beyerdynamic cans are useless though as somehow connecting it results in ghost clicks<br/><br/>Display: Amazing, if you know what AMOLED is you'd know the bright contrast-y nature of the display with equally amazing blacks.. and better power management. For the first time ever, started watching movies on mobiles<br/><br/>Processor, RAM and graphics: Snappy and does make you feel you are holding a fast, latest, flagship device. Should hold good for probably 2 years<br/><br/>Build quality: Very unchinesy (for want of a better word). Edges feel strong yet beautifully carved, sides are solid and buttons are tactile yet feel built to last. The package comes with a case and I am using a case. Another personal first! Oh, the package was thoughtful like none other. Almost feels like a personalized gift box<br/><br/>Battery: Pretty darn good. I was 98% at 2200 hours, used for 3-4 hours non-stop in the night and it still took me thru to 1700 hours the other day with medium to heavy usage. I just recently let battery go under 5% and feel it's discharging faster now (could only be psychological). Don't let battery go too low though in most likelihood it doesn't do anything as the phone shuts down before it reaches true 0<br/><br/>Camera: I bet this is what people are interested in most - the reason why it's last here! The hardware is not much different from the OP6 but in a blind camera test, the T took slightly better low light images with the 6 blowing off highlights more. It could be an issue with that one device but suffice to say the camera is awesome and very capable unless you go comparing with the Pixel 3. I was literally blown from the result of clicking a really, really dark scene and it still had magically squeezed in almost natural light in the picture - just don't expect to create a 10x10 photo frame and you'll be fine. In regular night scenes with some ambient light, there isn't much difference between Auto and night mode. Photography under normal light condition is good - adequately sharp, not overtly saturated and we'll detailed. I find the white balance slightly off but can be fixed in \"pro\" settings. At times, the highlight gets blown out but that's okay for a phone at this price point and I believe many of the camera shortcomings can be fixed with a software upgrade. I would have preferred a wide-angle camera over the depth camera - mind you, the depth camera too works brilliantly in portrait mode and gives you a more natural bokeh effect than software enhanced background blur<br/><br/>All in all, I am quite satisfied with the purchase and probably gonna stick with OnePlus having experimented with most Android manufacturers. Highly recommended!</span>\n",

       " <span>Verdict<br/>The OnePlus 6T brings new technology and worthwhile improvements to the table making this the best phone from OnePlus yet.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>New fingerprint sensor feels cutting-edge<br/>Up-to-date, versatile OS<br/>Fast Charge is still great<br/>Sleek, premium design<br/>Great performance<br/>Great battery life<br/>Cons<br/>Camera's Nightscape mode needs work<br/>Another headphone jack bites the dust<br/>Fingerprint sensor needs refinement<br/>Poor audio capabilities<br/>his affordable Android flagship sports a lightning-fast in-display fingerprint sensor and powerful performance for half the price of its rivals.<br/>Super-fast in-display fingerprint sensor<br/>Gorgeous display with tiny teardrop notch<br/>Improved camera support<br/>Android Pie out of the box.<br/>AGAINST<br/>No headphone jack<br/>Lacks wireless charging<br/>Camera: Improved, but not amazing<br/><br/>OnePlus didn't make any tweaks to the camera hardware in the 6T. Like the 6, the new model sports a dual-lens rear shooter with a 16-megapixel and 20-MP lens and a 20-MP front-facing lens.<br/><br/>But the company made some software enhancements to boost photo quality, particularly in portraits and at night. A new Night mode, which you can select from the lower menu in the camera preview, lengthens the exposure time to capture more detail in low-light settings.<br/>Unfortunately, that exposure doesn't do much to enhance the quality of a low-light image, as you can see in the below comparison of the same spooky Halloween display lit colorful lights and a street lamp. With Night mode activated, the shot is brighter overall but also looks overexposed, so you lose detail and contrast. The image isn't much better without Night mode, but looks slightly less grainy.<br/>The Pixel 3 captures the variation in the purple lights, and also brings up the contrast in the black spiders on the staircase. The red of the monstrous ghost's eyes and hands is far more vivid in the Pixel 3's shot. This is without the Pixel 3's forthcoming Night Sight mode, which reportedly makes the device's low-light shots dramatically better. The iPhone XR’s shot is more true-to-life — the purple and red hues look like they did in person, even if there's not as much contrast as in the Pixel 3's result.<br/>Performance: Flagship speed for less<br/><br/>The 6T shares the same specs as the 6, so performance is unchanged in the newer device. The phone's 8GB of RAM and Snapdragon 845 processor deliver flagship speeds, besting even Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 (with 6GB of RAM) and Google's Pixel 3 XL (4GB).<br/>Battery Life<br/><br/>The OnePlus 6T’s 3,700 mAh battery is slightly bigger than the OnePlus 6's 3,300 mAh pack, but the new device also has a slightly larger display. The two phones ran neck-and-neck in the Toms Guide Battery Test of continuous web-surfing over T-Mobile's LTE network, with the 6T lasting 10 hours and 23 minutes and the 6 lasting just 10 minutes longer. The smartphone average is 9:50.<br/><br/>In my five days of testing the 6T, I found it to be a champ. For instance, I charged up the 6T to 100 percent and then used it for 20 hours, from late afternoon to lunchtime the following day. I took the phone running, listening to the new Robyn album over Apple Music.<br/>OnePlus 6T vs. iPhone XR<br/><br/>The OnePlus 6T is cheaper than the iPhone XR while offering a bigger display. The 6.2-inch-long 6T is taller than the 5.9-inch-long iPhone XR, Apple's most affordable flagship iPhone. That extra height is all display — the 6T's 6.4-inch OLED panel is simply bigger than the XR's 6.1-inch screen.<br/><br/>For those of us with small hands, the taller screen makes it tougher to navigate the 6T one-handed than the XR, but there are worthwhile trade-offs.<br/>OnePlus 6T Cheat Sheet: What You Need to Know<br/><br/>The 6T is the first flagship phone released in the U.S. with an in-display fingerprint sensor. Spoiler alert: The sensor's lightning fast and amazing.<br/>T-Mobile customers can buy the 6T in-store, and it also supports Verizon's network.<br/>Farewell, headphone jack. OnePlus has parted ways with the 3.5mm port. A USB-C dongle is included in the box.<br/>Android 9.0 Pie with OyxgenOS doesn't feel bloated.<br/>New Night photography feature aims to improve low-light shots, but the Pixel 3 is better.<br/>A recently-released McLaren Edition offers 10GB of RAM, 256GB of storage and OnePlus' new Warp Charge system.<br/>Design: Matte beauty with teardrop notch<br/><br/>OnePlus isn't pushing any design boundaries with the 6T, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The matte Midnight Black model I tested is a subtle standout in a sea of glassy black 6-inch slabs (i.e., almost every other Android flagship). The glossy Mirror Black shade is more run-of-the-mill. Unfortunately, OnePlus isn't releasing a Silk White variant of the 6T, at least not yet. The pearly finish of that OnePlus 6 model was one-of-a-kind. The Mirror and Midnight Black hues are standard for OnePlus, so it would be nice to see a fresh shade for the  6T.OnePlus has slightly refined its go-to aesthetic for the 6T with tweaks like a teardrop-shaped notch, which is significantly smaller than the iPhone X-style notch at the top of the OnePlus 6's display. The 6T's bottom bezel is also a smidge thinner than its predecessor's. But the overall dimensions have remained largely the same over the years, even as display size has increased and the fingerprint sensor has moved from chin to back to beneath the display.<br/>glass with the 6T and ditched the headphone jack (yes, it's true), the company has still shied away from supporting wireless charging.<br/><br/>Display: Still stunning<br/><br/>The OnePlus 6T’s display quality easily rivals flagships twice its price. The expansive, 6.4-inch AMOLED (2340 x 1080) panel is slightly taller than the OnePlus 6's screen, but the most noticeable difference is the less obtrusive dewdrop notch. OnePlus slimmed down the camera cut-out from the 6's iPhone X replica to one that resembles the short-lived Essential Phone. The design tweak makes the screen feel truly edge-to-edge in a way that notched flagships don't.<br/>AGAINST<br/>'Only' full HD resolution<br/>No microSD card slot</span>\n",

       " <span>Design--<br/>The back is a swathe of curved glass 3D glass that sits comfortably against your palm. At launch the two colours: Midnight Black and Mirror Black, sport two distinctly different finishes. In my opinion, the Midnight Black model I tested is the better looking of the two, with a distinctive S-shaped reflection appearing across its back when the light hits it that has an almost opalescent quality.<br/><br/>Screen--<br/>The 6T packs the biggest display OnePlus has ever put on a phone. At 6.41-inches it’s sure to satisfy media-lovers, mobile photographers and gamers.6T supports the full DCI-P3 wide colour gamut and the company’s thrown in options for a variety other colour spaces too, such as sRGB, as well as a warm night and monochrome reading mode feature. The use of an AMOLED panel is appreciated too, ensuring great contrast and deep blacks, which again helps when enjoying video.<br/><br/>Performance--<br/>The ‘T’ series phones, like Google’s Pixel phones, come at an awkward time if you’re after the latest and greatest mobile processor on the market. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset at the heart of the OnePlus 6T is an undeniable powerhouse, that’s featured in nearly every 2018 flagship Android phone but it’s about to be supplanted.<br/><br/>Software(OOS)--<br/>OnePlus was among a handful of manufacturers that promised to deliver fast Android updates and with the OnePlus 6, it certainly delivered. The OnePlus 6T runs an enhanced version of that same Android 9.0 Pie experience out the box with OnePlus’ OxygenOS overlay on top.<br/>There’s little more I can say that I want from OnePlus’ take on Android here. I’d like a one-handed mode that actually shrinks the entire UI but I think I’m in the minority there, and I’m curious to try out the promised fingerprint-sensor based shortcuts feature but beyond that, perhaps a few fewer of OnePlus’ own apps stepping on Google’s toes wouldn’t hurt.<br/><br/>Camera--<br/>The camera hardware at play here appears to be identical to that of its predecessor, with a dual 16/20-megapixel snapper taking point, rocking a respectably wide f/1.7 aperture and PDAF (phase detection autofocus), along with OIS (optical image stabilisation) and enlarged 1.22µm pixels on that main 16-megapixel sensor. There’s also a 16-megapixel front-facer which leverages EIS (electronic image stabilisation). It’s a promising hardware setup.<br/><br/>Battery Life--<br/>The OnePlus 6T’s 3700mAh power pack is a winner based on my experiences.<br/>With 13 hours away from the wall plug and four hours of screen-on time, my OnePlus 6T finished the day at an even 50% charge. In that time I streamed 30 minutes of Netflix, which sapped 6% of the charge (with the screen brightness at half), while a 30 minute stretch of PUBG Mobile, running through multiple short, sharp arcade matches, took 8% out of the battery.Fast Charge (formerly Dash Charge) is a big reason to buy a OnePlus. It’s been the best fast-charging standard out there for a while (although that’s starting to change) and the company has distilled the premise with simple elegance into the tagline, “a day’s power in half an hour”.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>New fingerprint sensor feels cutting-edge<br/>Up-to-date, versatile OS<br/>Dash Charge is still great and better than OnePlus 6<br/>Sleek, premium design<br/>Great performance<br/>Great Camera<br/>Great battery life<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Camera's Nightscape mode(Focus) needs work<br/>Another headphone jack bites the dust<br/>Fingerprint sensor needs refinement<br/>No LED notification light<br/>No more colour options<br/><br/>PUBG Settings:<br/>Graphics- Upto HDR<br/>Frame Rate- upto Ultra<br/><br/>Verdict:<br/>The OnePlus 6T brings new technology and worthwhile improvements to the table but still needs some tweaking.<br/><br/>If you find this review as helpful then please click the helpful button.<br/>Thanks to all.</span>\n",

       " <span>I got 8GB * 128GB version. The review it in a word, it's a beast. CNET mentioned it as \"Hero phone without sky high Price\". It's true. At this price range it's a great value for money.  OnePlusen launching amazing phone's and this is the latest of the greats. No bloatware at all, nothing pre-installed except few handy OnePlus apps for file transfer and a forum, Definitely enhances the Pure Android OS.<br/><br/>Games are running at ultra or high. Haven't hanged at all with lot of apps running, gaming is smooth and this one has a RAM optimiser for the purpose, its my 1st time with SD 845, best fit into this. Good picture clarity too, nearly 2k.<br/><br/>Camera is great, especially the portrait mode. Selfies are neat. Though the 2nd lens purpose is limited, reading from most reviews.<br/><br/>Amazing UI, appreciation is heartfelt.<br/><br/>The build is brilliant and sleek. Comfortable to put it in pant pockets and can be handled with one hand though I won't necessarily do that 😄. Notch is unobtrusive and looks cool, and hiding option available. Night mode is a good thought. I don't have to download an extra app. (My 1st time with an OnePlus and I'm happy about the handy features it comes with, if some features I'm mentioning is already there leave it).<br/> In-display FP sensor is faster. I don't have compulsion for it to open in 0.0003 seconds like it has been stressed in the YouTube reviews, it's faster than fast-enough.<br/><br/>Battery life is awesome, 3.7k mah. It's like it has a compulsion to stay on. Not at all draining at any point.<br/><br/>Sound quality is great too, though stereo could have been better. It's like I'm hearing everything from right or left side, on landscape mode. Anyways I'm either going to use an external speaker or a headset, so no probs.<br/><br/>Pricing is great, definitely not overpriced. Phone with this specs are being sold at 10k higher prices or of lower quality of experience, by others, and this phone is built with Users in mind, I can confidently say that, it has many handy utilities.<br/><br/>Only problem is something that is not with the phone, actually 2 , a bit overpriced official protective bumper case, and no preferential tempered glass or information about if we need it at all. I got the phone on 2nd November, I still have that out of the box screen cover &amp; case. I couldn't find reliable tempered glass, the Amazon recommended are not fitting the phone screen, and their choice have changed twice in 3 days 😄 . So I've ordered 3 of them 😁 let's see which will fit, I'll return the other 2.<br/><br/>The protective bumper case is 2k, though it's official it can easily be priced 500rs below (don't say, you can buy the 1.2k priced one right? Both are a bit overpriced. You are great at what you do, you don't have to take pricing decisions like other phonemakers, your flagship is an example for that) And also to OnePlus guys, so many fake reviews in this area. You have to intervene, your product's accessories are being spammed by fake-reviewed Tglass sellers. Better you soon release your own tempered glass.<br/><br/> Got the promo code and getting the bullets headphone in a day's time. A small help from a beneficiary. Keep up the good work OnePlus.</span>\n",

       " <span>I have been using this phone since 3rd Nov, so after using it extensively for about 1 and a half month, here is what i think.<br/>• Performance : Overall performance is mind blowing.<br/>•Battery+Dash Charge : Battery life is just amazing and bundle it with the dash charging, u will never ever run out of power. (It makes up for no wireless charging and frankly it didnt even bother me)<br/>•Camera : Camera quality is superb, use it with pixels camera port and it can challenge any smartphone anyday. I have added one photo which i shot in very low light using night mode, u can check it.<br/>•Sound : Sound is also great (i have heard so many people complaining about absence of stereo speakers but i didn't notice much of a difference, it has performed upto the mark in every situation uptil now like in very noisy backgrounds)<br/>•Screen-Body Ratio : The bezels are so thin that u will fall in love with this phone if u watch videos and movies extensively on phones.<br/>•Display : The display is also very crsip and clear being fullhd+ display.<br/>•Security : Face unlock is lightning fast and u will not even see the lock screen most of the time during unlocking.<br/>•In-display fingerprint scanner is also good, not perfect as it sometimes dont recognise the finger but thats ok because with time u will get used to placing ur fingers in the required manner.<br/>•Build quality : It is very very Premium and u will feel really good while holding them in ur hands. Its design is very sleek and curvy edges makes them easy to hold.<br/>•Dual sim card, so that's another good thing.<br/>•Tiny Notch : I dont like notches but in todays world of notches its the best u can get, its very less intrusive and its so small that i dont even notice it now.<br/>•OxygenOs : its one of the reasons why i love one plus devices. The customisations available are just awesome. U can set up your phone the way u like it with pure stock android experience. Its just an icing on the cake.<br/>•Android Updates : its another thing which u will enjoy owning this device. Most of the companies dont provide that. (This is applicable to all one plus devices though)<br/>•Storage : Base storage is 128 gigs, thats huge.<br/><br/>The only drawback i find is absence of headphone jack which is not a deal breaker according to me as there are other alternatives to it, so u can easily move on to Bluetooth or type c headphones. Just like the time when touch screen phones were launched in the world of keypad phones people were sceptical back then also.<br/><br/>Notable mention : No IP rating is just a myth. Its totally water and dust resistant, i have seen a lot of videos on you tube confirming that. They just didn't want to increase the price to another 20-30$ in order to get that certification as they are very costly.<br/><br/>My opinion : Just go for it if you dont own one plus 6 or to some extent one plus 5t. Rest if u are looking for an upgrade, this is the one u should get.<br/><br/>I hope i cleared ur doubts. Thanks.</span>\n",

       " <span>Pros:<br/>Superb battery life...streches to 7hrs of screen on time..on heavy usage 5.5 to 6 hrs screen on time.<br/>Camera quality...well lets just say its good but for the price range,its mediocore...but most of us wont even notice the difference. Though the slow motion is cool but its of zero use at night.<br/>Built quality....extremely good and feels premium to hold.<br/>I went fir tge mirror back edition,though what they say is true,it is a smudge magnet.but still tuck it in a tpu clearcase and it it looks awesome.<br/>Sound quality...its one of the best i used till date..its so loud that that my room mates have grown to hate it :D<br/>coming to the display...well it okay sort...my previous op3t had a better display than this...*on comparing op6,op6t and op3t hands on..i'd op3t was the best followed by op6 and then op6t! The coloyrs are much vibrant on the previous two even when kept on same settings(default screen calibration).<br/>It takes exact 1hr and 27 mins to charge from 0 to 100...same as op6...despite having a bigger battery.<br/>Ummm what else....<br/>Yeah...the finger print sensor...i know its slow as comoared to the traditional finger print sensor...but God its so cool..the difference is notocable for people coming from one plus line.<br/>But the lag of 0.20s is acceptable...with the contant ota ipdates the fingerprint sensor has seem to gather up speed and seems to open much faster..<br/>Its open 8 out of 10 times i try..but with face unlock on..you wont even notice the delay of 0.20s...<br/>But belive me...it is fast...damn fast as comoared to the other phones out in the market...tested it against vivo v11 pro.. verdict: op6t blows it out of the park.<br/>Oxygen Os...has gone to a whole different level with gestures 2.0. add 8gb of ram and a snapdragon 845...you just glide from one app to the other...buttery smooth...they werent lying when they cam up with the advertisement for op6t!!!<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The nightscape mode is more of like a hit and miss thing...at lowest it will give you an image with 0 enhancement...but whennit does it job,it produces fairly good images..but at the cost of sharpness.<br/>Headphone jack....well i miss it..i often hate the fact that i need to unplug the charger  to listen to music or watch a video at the end of the day.<br/>The weight is noticable...my op3t was about 155gms...op6t is now 185gms...so i constantly realise when i pick up the phone...dang this is heavy!!!<br/>It is a tad bit narrower than op6 about 0.5mm and with the screen size being so large..its seems like a long glowing rod at night!<br/>Also since the screens are rounded at the corners there is loss in pixel and video content...you will notice it much clearly while playing pubg...afterall the game has more buttons than a nascar car!<br/><br/>If you have any questions,do ask!</span>\n",

       " <span>Overall: 8/10:<br/>A fantastic package at good value. 6T McLaren is'nt much different from the standard 6T except for the RAM and some minor cosmetic changes. But for a long time fan of the Silver Arrows from Mika Hakkinen's time, a small increase in price was worth it. Call me sentimental! :)<br/><br/>Unboxing &amp; contents: 8/10<br/>One of the coolest unboxing experiences. The McLaren box is very premium and the booklet starts with giving you a brief glimpse into the history of the brand and some cool pictures from the archives. It is an homage to Bruce McLaren to be honest. The Speed Mark (real Carbon Fire cutout of the McLaren logo) encased in acrylic is pretty good and can serve as a cool table top accessory or paper weight. If not for much it can be a good ice breaker for visitors to your home / office. The Charger and Cable are also customized for the McLaren edition. The Soft PU case is simple black and fits snugly. There was a missed opportunity to throw in some colour for the McLaren edition. All else is pretty much standard. Providing only a USB-C to 3.5 converter is a bummer. For the flagship offering at over 50K, throwing in a Bullet Earphone should have been standard.<br/><br/>First Impressions: 9/10<br/>The device is actually pretty impressive looking. Especially the orange accents at the Bezel on the back. When you change the angle under light, it almost looks like there are LEDs inside. It looks premium for sure though an actual Carbon Fibre body would have been awesome! Be warned though that the surface is a fingerprint magnet and not easy to wipe off unless you use a good cleaning spray. The Waterdrop notch is barely noticeable and is not much of an issue. The colours are vibrant and while setting up you can choose a profile that suits your taste.<br/><br/>Setup: 8/10<br/>The SIM Card tray is a standard two Nano-SIM one. No SD Card support still! But with 240 GB usable memory, not much of an issue to be honest. I used the OnePlus switch app to transfer my apps, data and settings. The transition was hassle free and took all of 15 minutes. Most apps worked immediately but a few needed to be uninstalled and reinstalled as they were acting up. I gave it a point less as I think the OnePlus Switch app should be integrated at the setup stage instead of making a new user download it. The phone heats up considerably but it was fine after the initial 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Battery: 7/10<br/>The unit came with 50% power out of the box and it took me a good 30 minutes to get it to 75% despite using the Warp Charge @ 30W. Probably it was due to the fact that close to 100 apps were being downloaded while it was charging. I will check the charging performance over the next few weeks and update review if required.<br/><br/>Performance: 9/10<br/>Gaming: Initial performance on gaming is very very good (Asphalt 9 Legends and Real Racing 3). Zero lag and super smooth rendering.  Bloons TD6 is a very resource hungry at lategame levels and the 6T McLaren  made short work of it.<br/><br/>Display: The display is really mind-blowing. Video on Youtube and other streaming apps was super smooth and brilliant to look at. One cool feature is that you can pinch zoom the content to include / exclude the waterdrop notch for front camera.  Adaptive brightness is annoying at times and I had to turn it off while playing the racing games.<br/><br/>Camera: Have not tested the Camera performance yet. Especially the 4K 60 FPS option. Will do it soon and update the review.<br/><br/>Hope this helps!</span>\n",

OnePlus has taken care that removing the audio jack doesn't *force* one to buy new headphones.<br/><br/>• The *phone cover* is sufficient and one wouldn't need to buy a new cover unless one likes to have personalized phone covers.<br/><br/>Review<br/><br/>I reluctantly exchanged my note 4 for this but after weeks use, I feel this is awesome despite few glitches<br/><br/>My Experience as a power user of phones:<br/><br/>I bought this phone by using the exchange offer with the MI Note 4 that I had used for over two years. Being a power user, high-graphics gamer, freelance graphic designer, developer, an entrepreneur &amp; a multi tasker, I find OnePlus 6T (OxygenOS) so much worth the purchase. Specially so when I am transitioning from MI Note 4 (MIUI). OnePlus 6T is an incremental upgrade to the OnePlus 6T with subtle but significant upgrades. But there is always something positive and negative about a device so following is what I feel about it:<br/><br/>• The fingerprint scanner that was the key selling point for OnePlus 6T isnt as impressive as it seemed to be earlier before using the phone for a week. It is good but it isnt as fast as face recognition or back side fingerprint scanner. The major cause of this is that the back side fingerprint scanner in the previous model 6 was a definite point that was locatable but in 6T this area is on the screen and you need to tap the screen to get the area of fingerprint scanner to show and then you have to do the needful. This is like a step extra versus the previous models quick screen unlock with same level of security. This is a 2 second wasted only to unlock the screen.<br/><br/>• The sound quality and camera quality is exceptionally awesome. No flaws in them for this level of pricing. There are few so called better ones in other brands but then better is a debatable word with camera output quality.<br/><br/>• Storage / model options: I have seen the mirror version of version 6 with my friend and the midnight black that I have been using of version 6. Midnight black is just so so buttery smooth to enjoy and feel while using the phone that makes it seem like everything is on screen surface and covering the full screen area. Mirror version becomes boring and frustrating after a point because of the fingerprints that are left visible all over the back side of the body so easily everytime.<br/><br/>• In-display fingerprint scanner / sensor: OnePlus’s dedicated fingerprint scanner has always been a secure and fastest scanner around. With in-display scanner they have integrated the fingerprint scanner inside the device remarkably well. It is fast enough to call it quick but sure isn’t as fast as dedicated scanner module which it implemented in OnePlus 6’s rear.<br/><br/>• Blazing fast: There is nothing more pleasing that having a fluid experience using a phone and OnePlus 6T is blazing fast. Multi-tasking is such a breeze with 6T. Test it with almost any (and virtually as many) apps and 1+ 6T will deliver! Gaming Mode just adds to this beefy specs while you are gaming.<br/><br/>• Gestures: After using it once and I dont want to go back to using buttons (almost definitely). The gestures add so much to its intuitive, smooth user experience, while getting work done faster and without any hassle.<br/><br/>• Camera: I make some videos of indoor interviews often night light as well and some casual street photography. This 6T camera delivers to the price. Infact more, it is such an ease taking low-light photos without having to worry about setting up a light or finding a good light source.<br/><br/>• Audio: The audio in this phone is aptly loud and with nice bass that a mobile phone can pack. OnePlus 6 had a very shrieky noisy sort of high-volume issue. But this one has a much more crisp and clearer stereo like speaker feel.<br/><br/>• Faster charging: As always OnePlus is much loved for its fast charging and adding ~400 mAh to the battery 6T makes it all much more pleasing.<br/><br/>• Larger &amp; stronger display: The display is now Corning Gorilla Glass 6 sized at 6.41” which is just as much wide as OnePlus 6’s Corning GG 5 sized at 6.28” but with more height-giving aspect ratio of 19.5:9 aspect ratio and believe me watching movies, YouTube is such a bliss!!!<br/><br/>• Just a Notch: It’s a huge improvement over OnePlus 6’s slab shaped huge notch. The notch in 6T is tear drop shaped and well designed, sized. It rather makes the appearance of the screen very attractive  It improves the overall usability and feel of display by many folds.<br/><br/>• 3.5mm Audio jack is Gone: USB Type-C is all you need to charge the phone or listen to music. You need a type-C to 3.5mm audio jack/adapter within the package though which comes as a huge relief incase I am stuck with using an ordinary 3.5mm Headphones.<br/><br/>• If you are a One Plus 6 owner you would like this thing about the charger that it is of same specifications in terms of electric input and output. You can use the same charger for both the phones. This saves you from the hassle of storing two chargers for two same brand phones.<br/><br/>• 3700 mAh: Beefed up the battery (maybe that’s why the audio jack had to go). But this also means longer charging time with the same charger as OnePlus 6 but that is okay i think since it still is fast compared to other phones. Lot of people are crying for wireless charging. I guess they dont know about the slow charging speed and longer charging time for the smartphones. Everyone who has used the fast charger knows that wireless charging is not as great as it sounds.<br/><br/>•  The software feature of Screen Brightness is a big dislike. Since the new OS update, OP6 and OP6T both have had very bad transition scale in terms of screen brightness. Earlier the screen was enough bright at 30% thus saving batter, but now even indoor use requires screen brightness to be set at 60% to be able to use phone properly. This is a big let down as it consumes a lot of battery.<br/><br/>• The new software update has some improvements in Camera and gestures and some patch fixes. This is good, especially the nightscape camera features takes amazing low light contrast pictures (one nightscape mode shot pictures has been attached).<br/><br/>• But the new swipe gesture addition to switch between previous and next apps has caused the previously existent two gestures for going to the tray and going back has become way slower and sometimes non responsive. In an effort to add something just not required, the previous smooth gestures transitions has been sacrificed. This is just wasnt called for.</span>\n",

       "[\"\\nI'll split the review into sections to make it easy to understand.Delivery 10/10: I placed the order on the 2nd since the 8/256 model was out of stock and I was supposed to receive the phone on the 4th however I was pleasantly surprised when the order shipped and was at my doorstep on the 2nd itself so kudos to the seller and Amazon for a great delivery experience.Now onto the phone...Build 8/10: The body of the phone is metal and the design is ergonomic. Not a huge change from the OP6 other than the lack of a fingerprint sensor. A lack of headphone jack is problematic.Screen 10/10: 6.44 inch 2560x1080 AMOLED display. A gorgeous display with vivid colors and true blacks, feels better than many 2K screens and the load on the battery is reduced massively as well. The notch is improved massively as well as it feels less intrusive and easier to adopt. With an 86% screen to body ratio, the experience is immersive.Internals and Software 10/10: 8GB RAM and 256GB of storage is future proof enough and can handle anything thrown at it. OxygenOS with Android Pie is greatly optimized with some useful features and the performance is fast, lag-free and snappy. SD845 is best in class and the GPU can handle heavy games with ease.Camera 9/10: While it sports the same lens as its predecessor, the software tweaks and optimization makes it feel like a massive upgrade with noticeably better photos than the OP6 as well as great improvement with the Night mode in taking photos in low light. You can shoot 720p video at 480fps as well as 4K 60fps (limited to 5 minutes at a stretch) and the inclusion of pro mode makes it easier to tweak the camera according to your needs. The front camera is crisp and an improvement over its predecessor. While it may not be as exceptional as the Pixel 3 or Note 9, it is still the best camera in its price range.Battery life ?/10: It's still too early to give an honest review about the battery life however the 3700mah capacity paired with the industry leading fast-charging technology makes it one of the best phone batteries. In my short use of the phone so far I've consistently got 4.5-5 hours SoT and the standby time is insane as well. This is one of the best phones battery management wise bar the Note 9.New features: While the fingerprint sensor is now embedded under the screen, it is more of a positive point for the screen to body ratio than the security aspect of the phone. While it definitely is not gimmicky, it is not completely useful as well. It's plenty fast despite being a first-generation in-screen reader however still slower than physical button readers as well as the native face unlock (which is really really good and insanely fast even in low light) If you're someone who disables face unlock and will only use your fingerprint then it is good enough for your daily needs.Sound 7/10: Due to the reduced notch, the earpiece is shifted into the top slit however it is still plenty audible and really clear. The speaker despite being a mono downward firing one is loud enough to play music and answer calls from far away. One issue I have with the bottom speaker is that despite being two grills, one on either side of the type C slot, there is only one speaker which is the left one which means if you cover it you will muffle 90% of the sound also by looking at the pictures you might assume it might be dual bottom firing speakers but it's only one (so it might seem like false advertising?) but still it doesn't affect the quality or the loudness of the sound one bit so I may be nitpicking here. A lack of headphone jack means you have to settle for bt audio or use the dongle provided by oneplus for free in the box. Since I am coming from an LG G6 which had a 32-bit Quad DAC it is a big letdown since USB-C audio is still garbage and wireless music still cannot compete in quality with wired.Conclusion:+Screen+Battery+Internals+Software+Camera+Phone comes with screen protector pre-applied and with a free transparent TPU case in the box so good on OP to think about the customer-no 3.5mm jack-no wireless charging (not important for me)BEST FLAGSHIP FOR UNDER 50K DESPITE LOSING THE HEADPHONE JACK, THE OTHER GOOD FEATURES MORE THAN MAKE UP FOR IT.

       " '\\nNever in my life I waited for a phone this bad and happy to say the wait was worth it. My LG started giving me issues just after a few months and the Samsung before that had 3 display issues in about 15 months. Tired of splurging on flagship Androids, I started looking for alternatives - the cheaper kinds, the more value for money kindsOnePlus has a pretty loyal band of followers but I never appreciated the Chinese-ness of it but boy, the device is as premium as it can get. OnePlus 6 as I understood from my friends was a great device and OnePlus 6T ought to be better, right? Well, it is, objectively.Call quality: Isn\\'t that the primary purpose of any phone. Much better than the LG which was as good as unusable and slightly topping the SamsungsSpeaker: Reasonably loud to be useful but don\\'t expect it to win sound quality awards. My LG with DAC stands defeated when I use it with my earphones and headphones. My Beyerdynamic cans are useless though as somehow connecting it results in ghost clicksDisplay: Amazing, if you know what AMOLED is you\\'d know the bright contrast-y nature of the display with equally amazing blacks.. and better power management. For the first time ever, started watching movies on mobilesProcessor, RAM and graphics: Snappy and does make you feel you are holding a fast, latest, flagship device. Should hold good for probably 2 yearsBuild quality: Very unchinesy (for want of a better word). Edges feel strong yet beautifully carved, sides are solid and buttons are tactile yet feel built to last. The package comes with a case and I am using a case. Another personal first! Oh, the package was thoughtful like none other. Almost feels like a personalized gift boxBattery: Pretty darn good. I was 98% at 2200 hours, used for 3-4 hours non-stop in the night and it still took me thru to 1700 hours the other day with medium to heavy usage. I just recently let battery go under 5% and feel it\\'s discharging faster now (could only be psychological). Don\\'t let battery go too low though in most likelihood it doesn\\'t do anything as the phone shuts down before it reaches true 0Camera: I bet this is what people are interested in most - the reason why it\\'s last here! The hardware is not much different from the OP6 but in a blind camera test, the T took slightly better low light images with the 6 blowing off highlights more. It could be an issue with that one device but suffice to say the camera is awesome and very capable unless you go comparing with the Pixel 3. I was literally blown from the result of clicking a really, really dark scene and it still had magically squeezed in almost natural light in the picture - just don\\'t expect to create a 10x10 photo frame and you\\'ll be fine. In regular night scenes with some ambient light, there isn\\'t much difference between Auto and night mode. Photography under normal light condition is good - adequately sharp, not overtly saturated and we\\'ll detailed. I find the white balance slightly off but can be fixed in \"pro\" settings. At times, the highlight gets blown out but that\\'s okay for a phone at this price point and I believe many of the camera shortcomings can be fixed with a software upgrade. I would have preferred a wide-angle camera over the depth camera - mind you, the depth camera too works brilliantly in portrait mode and gives you a more natural bokeh effect than software enhanced background blurAll in all, I am quite satisfied with the purchase and probably gonna stick with OnePlus having experimented with most Android manufacturers. Highly recommended!\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nVerdictThe OnePlus 6T brings new technology and worthwhile improvements to the table making this the best phone from OnePlus yet.ProsNew fingerprint sensor feels cutting-edgeUp-to-date, versatile OSFast Charge is still greatSleek, premium designGreat performanceGreat battery lifeConsCamera's Nightscape mode needs workAnother headphone jack bites the dustFingerprint sensor needs refinementPoor audio capabilitieshis affordable Android flagship sports a lightning-fast in-display fingerprint sensor and powerful performance for half the price of its rivals.Super-fast in-display fingerprint sensorGorgeous display with tiny teardrop notchImproved camera supportAndroid Pie out of the box.AGAINSTNo headphone jackLacks wireless chargingCamera: Improved, but not amazingOnePlus didn't make any tweaks to the camera hardware in the 6T. Like the 6, the new model sports a dual-lens rear shooter with a 16-megapixel and 20-MP lens and a 20-MP front-facing lens.But the company made some software enhancements to boost photo quality, particularly in portraits and at night. A new Night mode, which you can select from the lower menu in the camera preview, lengthens the exposure time to capture more detail in low-light settings.Unfortunately, that exposure doesn't do much to enhance the quality of a low-light image, as you can see in the below comparison of the same spooky Halloween display lit colorful lights and a street lamp. With Night mode activated, the shot is brighter overall but also looks overexposed, so you lose detail and contrast. The image isn't much better without Night mode, but looks slightly less grainy.The Pixel 3 captures the variation in the purple lights, and also brings up the contrast in the black spiders on the staircase. The red of the monstrous ghost's eyes and hands is far more vivid in the Pixel 3's shot. This is without the Pixel 3's forthcoming Night Sight mode, which reportedly makes the device's low-light shots dramatically better. The iPhone XR’s shot is more true-to-life — the purple and red hues look like they did in person, even if there's not as much contrast as in the Pixel 3's result.Performance: Flagship speed for lessThe 6T shares the same specs as the 6, so performance is unchanged in the newer device. The phone's 8GB of RAM and Snapdragon 845 processor deliver flagship speeds, besting even Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 (with 6GB of RAM) and Google's Pixel 3 XL (4GB).Battery LifeThe OnePlus 6T’s 3,700 mAh battery is slightly bigger than the OnePlus 6's 3,300 mAh pack, but the new device also has a slightly larger display. The two phones ran neck-and-neck in the Toms Guide Battery Test of continuous web-surfing over T-Mobile's LTE network, with the 6T lasting 10 hours and 23 minutes and the 6 lasting just 10 minutes longer. The smartphone average is 9:50.In my five days of testing the 6T, I found it to be a champ. For instance, I charged up the 6T to 100 percent and then used it for 20 hours, from late afternoon to lunchtime the following day. I took the phone running, listening to the new Robyn album over Apple Music.OnePlus 6T vs. iPhone XRThe OnePlus 6T is cheaper than the iPhone XR while offering a bigger display. The 6.2-inch-long 6T is taller than the 5.9-inch-long iPhone XR, Apple's most affordable flagship iPhone. That extra height is all display — the 6T's 6.4-inch OLED panel is simply bigger than the XR's 6.1-inch screen.For those of us with small hands, the taller screen makes it tougher to navigate the 6T one-handed than the XR, but there are worthwhile trade-offs.OnePlus 6T Cheat Sheet: What You Need to KnowThe 6T is the first flagship phone released in the U.S. with an in-display fingerprint sensor. Spoiler alert: The sensor's lightning fast and amazing.T-Mobile customers can buy the 6T in-store, and it also supports Verizon's network.Farewell, headphone jack. OnePlus has parted ways with the 3.5mm port. A USB-C dongle is included in the box.Android 9.0 Pie with OyxgenOS doesn't feel bloated.New Night photography feature aims to improve low-light shots, but the Pixel 3 is better.A recently-released McLaren Edition offers 10GB of RAM, 256GB of storage and OnePlus' new Warp Charge system.Design: Matte beauty with teardrop notchOnePlus isn't pushing any design boundaries with the 6T, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The matte Midnight Black model I tested is a subtle standout in a sea of glassy black 6-inch slabs (i.e., almost every other Android flagship). The glossy Mirror Black shade is more run-of-the-mill. Unfortunately, OnePlus isn't releasing a Silk White variant of the 6T, at least not yet. The pearly finish of that OnePlus 6 model was one-of-a-kind. The Mirror and Midnight Black hues are standard for OnePlus, so it would be nice to see a fresh shade for the  6T.OnePlus has slightly refined its go-to aesthetic for the 6T with tweaks like a teardrop-shaped notch, which is significantly smaller than the iPhone X-style notch at the top of the OnePlus 6's display. The 6T's bottom bezel is also a smidge thinner than its predecessor's. But the overall dimensions have remained largely the same over the years, even as display size has increased and the fingerprint sensor has moved from chin to back to beneath the display.glass with the 6T and ditched the headphone jack (yes, it's true), the company has still shied away from supporting wireless charging.Display: Still stunningThe OnePlus 6T’s display quality easily rivals flagships twice its price. The expansive, 6.4-inch AMOLED (2340 x 1080) panel is slightly taller than the OnePlus 6's screen, but the most noticeable difference is the less obtrusive dewdrop notch. OnePlus slimmed down the camera cut-out from the 6's iPhone X replica to one that resembles the short-lived Essential Phone. The design tweak makes the screen feel truly edge-to-edge in a way that notched flagships don't.AGAINST'Only' full HD resolutionNo microSD card slot\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nDesign--The back is a swathe of curved glass 3D glass that sits comfortably against your palm. At launch the two colours: Midnight Black and Mirror Black, sport two distinctly different finishes. In my opinion, the Midnight Black model I tested is the better looking of the two, with a distinctive S-shaped reflection appearing across its back when the light hits it that has an almost opalescent quality.Screen--The 6T packs the biggest display OnePlus has ever put on a phone. At 6.41-inches it’s sure to satisfy media-lovers, mobile photographers and gamers.6T supports the full DCI-P3 wide colour gamut and the company’s thrown in options for a variety other colour spaces too, such as sRGB, as well as a warm night and monochrome reading mode feature. The use of an AMOLED panel is appreciated too, ensuring great contrast and deep blacks, which again helps when enjoying video.Performance--The ‘T’ series phones, like Google’s Pixel phones, come at an awkward time if you’re after the latest and greatest mobile processor on the market. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset at the heart of the OnePlus 6T is an undeniable powerhouse, that’s featured in nearly every 2018 flagship Android phone but it’s about to be supplanted.Software(OOS)--OnePlus was among a handful of manufacturers that promised to deliver fast Android updates and with the OnePlus 6, it certainly delivered. The OnePlus 6T runs an enhanced version of that same Android 9.0 Pie experience out the box with OnePlus’ OxygenOS overlay on top.There’s little more I can say that I want from OnePlus’ take on Android here. I’d like a one-handed mode that actually shrinks the entire UI but I think I’m in the minority there, and I’m curious to try out the promised fingerprint-sensor based shortcuts feature but beyond that, perhaps a few fewer of OnePlus’ own apps stepping on Google’s toes wouldn’t hurt.Camera--The camera hardware at play here appears to be identical to that of its predecessor, with a dual 16/20-megapixel snapper taking point, rocking a respectably wide f/1.7 aperture and PDAF (phase detection autofocus), along with OIS (optical image stabilisation) and enlarged 1.22µm pixels on that main 16-megapixel sensor. There’s also a 16-megapixel front-facer which leverages EIS (electronic image stabilisation). It’s a promising hardware setup.Battery Life--The OnePlus 6T’s 3700mAh power pack is a winner based on my experiences.With 13 hours away from the wall plug and four hours of screen-on time, my OnePlus 6T finished the day at an even 50% charge. In that time I streamed 30 minutes of Netflix, which sapped 6% of the charge (with the screen brightness at half), while a 30 minute stretch of PUBG Mobile, running through multiple short, sharp arcade matches, took 8% out of the battery.Fast Charge (formerly Dash Charge) is a big reason to buy a OnePlus. It’s been the best fast-charging standard out there for a while (although that’s starting to change) and the company has distilled the premise with simple elegance into the tagline, “a day’s power in half an hour”.Pros:New fingerprint sensor feels cutting-edgeUp-to-date, versatile OSDash Charge is still great and better than OnePlus 6Sleek, premium designGreat performanceGreat CameraGreat battery lifeCons:Camera's Nightscape mode(Focus) needs workAnother headphone jack bites the dustFingerprint sensor needs refinementNo LED notification lightNo more colour optionsPUBG Settings:Graphics- Upto HDRFrame Rate- upto UltraVerdict:The OnePlus 6T brings new technology and worthwhile improvements to the table but still needs some tweaking.If you find this review as helpful then please click the helpful button.Thanks to all.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nI got 8GB * 128GB version. The review it in a word, it\\'s a beast. CNET mentioned it as \"Hero phone without sky high Price\". It\\'s true. At this price range it\\'s a great value for money.  OnePlusen launching amazing phone\\'s and this is the latest of the greats. No bloatware at all, nothing pre-installed except few handy OnePlus apps for file transfer and a forum, Definitely enhances the Pure Android OS.Games are running at ultra or high. Haven\\'t hanged at all with lot of apps running, gaming is smooth and this one has a RAM optimiser for the purpose, its my 1st time with SD 845, best fit into this. Good picture clarity too, nearly 2k.Camera is great, especially the portrait mode. Selfies are neat. Though the 2nd lens purpose is limited, reading from most reviews.Amazing UI, appreciation is heartfelt.The build is brilliant and sleek. Comfortable to put it in pant pockets and can be handled with one hand though I won\\'t necessarily do that 😄. Notch is unobtrusive and looks cool, and hiding option available. Night mode is a good thought. I don\\'t have to download an extra app. (My 1st time with an OnePlus and I\\'m happy about the handy features it comes with, if some features I\\'m mentioning is already there leave it). In-display FP sensor is faster. I don\\'t have compulsion for it to open in 0.0003 seconds like it has been stressed in the YouTube reviews, it\\'s faster than fast-enough.Battery life is awesome, 3.7k mah. It\\'s like it has a compulsion to stay on. Not at all draining at any point.Sound quality is great too, though stereo could have been better. It\\'s like I\\'m hearing everything from right or left side, on landscape mode. Anyways I\\'m either going to use an external speaker or a headset, so no probs.Pricing is great, definitely not overpriced. Phone with this specs are being sold at 10k higher prices or of lower quality of experience, by others, and this phone is built with Users in mind, I can confidently say that, it has many handy utilities.Only problem is something that is not with the phone, actually 2 , a bit overpriced official protective bumper case, and no preferential tempered glass or information about if we need it at all. I got the phone on 2nd November, I still have that out of the box screen cover & case. I couldn\\'t find reliable tempered glass, the Amazon recommended are not fitting the phone screen, and their choice have changed twice in 3 days 😄 . So I\\'ve ordered 3 of them 😁 let\\'s see which will fit, I\\'ll return the other 2.The protective bumper case is 2k, though it\\'s official it can easily be priced 500rs below (don\\'t say, you can buy the 1.2k priced one right? Both are a bit overpriced. You are great at what you do, you don\\'t have to take pricing decisions like other phonemakers, your flagship is an example for that) And also to OnePlus guys, so many fake reviews in this area. You have to intervene, your product\\'s accessories are being spammed by fake-reviewed Tglass sellers. Better you soon release your own tempered glass. Got the promo code and getting the bullets headphone in a day\\'s time. A small help from a beneficiary. Keep up the good work OnePlus.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using this phone since 3rd Nov, so after using it extensively for about 1 and a half month, here is what i think.• Performance : Overall performance is mind blowing.•Battery+Dash Charge : Battery life is just amazing and bundle it with the dash charging, u will never ever run out of power. (It makes up for no wireless charging and frankly it didnt even bother me)•Camera : Camera quality is superb, use it with pixels camera port and it can challenge any smartphone anyday. I have added one photo which i shot in very low light using night mode, u can check it.•Sound : Sound is also great (i have heard so many people complaining about absence of stereo speakers but i didn't notice much of a difference, it has performed upto the mark in every situation uptil now like in very noisy backgrounds)•Screen-Body Ratio : The bezels are so thin that u will fall in love with this phone if u watch videos and movies extensively on phones.•Display : The display is also very crsip and clear being fullhd+ display.•Security : Face unlock is lightning fast and u will not even see the lock screen most of the time during unlocking.•In-display fingerprint scanner is also good, not perfect as it sometimes dont recognise the finger but thats ok because with time u will get used to placing ur fingers in the required manner.•Build quality : It is very very Premium and u will feel really good while holding them in ur hands. Its design is very sleek and curvy edges makes them easy to hold.•Dual sim card, so that's another good thing.•Tiny Notch : I dont like notches but in todays world of notches its the best u can get, its very less intrusive and its so small that i dont even notice it now.•OxygenOs : its one of the reasons why i love one plus devices. The customisations available are just awesome. U can set up your phone the way u like it with pure stock android experience. Its just an icing on the cake.•Android Updates : its another thing which u will enjoy owning this device. Most of the companies dont provide that. (This is applicable to all one plus devices though)•Storage : Base storage is 128 gigs, thats huge.The only drawback i find is absence of headphone jack which is not a deal breaker according to me as there are other alternatives to it, so u can easily move on to Bluetooth or type c headphones. Just like the time when touch screen phones were launched in the world of keypad phones people were sceptical back then also.Notable mention : No IP rating is just a myth. Its totally water and dust resistant, i have seen a lot of videos on you tube confirming that. They just didn't want to increase the price to another 20-30$ in order to get that certification as they are very costly.My opinion : Just go for it if you dont own one plus 6 or to some extent one plus 5t. Rest if u are looking for an upgrade, this is the one u should get.I hope i cleared ur doubts. Thanks.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nPros:Superb battery life...streches to 7hrs of screen on time..on heavy usage 5.5 to 6 hrs screen on time.Camera quality...well lets just say its good but for the price range,its mediocore...but most of us wont even notice the difference. Though the slow motion is cool but its of zero use at night.Built quality....extremely good and feels premium to hold.I went fir tge mirror back edition,though what they say is true,it is a smudge magnet.but still tuck it in a tpu clearcase and it it looks awesome.Sound quality...its one of the best i used till date..its so loud that that my room mates have grown to hate it :Dcoming to the display...well it okay sort...my previous op3t had a better display than this...*on comparing op6,op6t and op3t hands on..i'd op3t was the best followed by op6 and then op6t! The coloyrs are much vibrant on the previous two even when kept on same settings(default screen calibration).It takes exact 1hr and 27 mins to charge from 0 to 100...same as op6...despite having a bigger battery.Ummm what else....Yeah...the finger print sensor...i know its slow as comoared to the traditional finger print sensor...but God its so cool..the difference is notocable for people coming from one plus line.But the lag of 0.20s is acceptable...with the contant ota ipdates the fingerprint sensor has seem to gather up speed and seems to open much faster..Its open 8 out of 10 times i try..but with face unlock on..you wont even notice the delay of 0.20s...But belive me...it is fast...damn fast as comoared to the other phones out in the market...tested it against vivo v11 pro.. verdict: op6t blows it out of the park.Oxygen Os...has gone to a whole different level with gestures 2.0. add 8gb of ram and a snapdragon 845...you just glide from one app to the other...buttery smooth...they werent lying when they cam up with the advertisement for op6t!!!Cons:The nightscape mode is more of like a hit and miss thing...at lowest it will give you an image with 0 enhancement...but whennit does it job,it produces fairly good images..but at the cost of sharpness.Headphone jack....well i miss it..i often hate the fact that i need to unplug the charger  to listen to music or watch a video at the end of the day.The weight is noticable...my op3t was about 155gms...op6t is now 185gms...so i constantly realise when i pick up the phone...dang this is heavy!!!It is a tad bit narrower than op6 about 0.5mm and with the screen size being so large..its seems like a long glowing rod at night!Also since the screens are rounded at the corners there is loss in pixel and video content...you will notice it much clearly while playing pubg...afterall the game has more buttons than a nascar car!If you have any questions,do ask!\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nOverall: 8/10:A fantastic package at good value. 6T McLaren is'nt much different from the standard 6T except for the RAM and some minor cosmetic changes. But for a long time fan of the Silver Arrows from Mika Hakkinen's time, a small increase in price was worth it. Call me sentimental! :)Unboxing & contents: 8/10One of the coolest unboxing experiences. The McLaren box is very premium and the booklet starts with giving you a brief glimpse into the history of the brand and some cool pictures from the archives. It is an homage to Bruce McLaren to be honest. The Speed Mark (real Carbon Fire cutout of the McLaren logo) encased in acrylic is pretty good and can serve as a cool table top accessory or paper weight. If not for much it can be a good ice breaker for visitors to your home / office. The Charger and Cable are also customized for the McLaren edition. The Soft PU case is simple black and fits snugly. There was a missed opportunity to throw in some colour for the McLaren edition. All else is pretty much standard. Providing only a USB-C to 3.5 converter is a bummer. For the flagship offering at over 50K, throwing in a Bullet Earphone should have been standard.First Impressions: 9/10The device is actually pretty impressive looking. Especially the orange accents at the Bezel on the back. When you change the angle under light, it almost looks like there are LEDs inside. It looks premium for sure though an actual Carbon Fibre body would have been awesome! Be warned though that the surface is a fingerprint magnet and not easy to wipe off unless you use a good cleaning spray. The Waterdrop notch is barely noticeable and is not much of an issue. The colours are vibrant and while setting up you can choose a profile that suits your taste.Setup: 8/10The SIM Card tray is a standard two Nano-SIM one. No SD Card support still! But with 240 GB usable memory, not much of an issue to be honest. I used the OnePlus switch app to transfer my apps, data and settings. The transition was hassle free and took all of 15 minutes. Most apps worked immediately but a few needed to be uninstalled and reinstalled as they were acting up. I gave it a point less as I think the OnePlus Switch app should be integrated at the setup stage instead of making a new user download it. The phone heats up considerably but it was fine after the initial 30 minutes.Battery: 7/10The unit came with 50% power out of the box and it took me a good 30 minutes to get it to 75% despite using the Warp Charge @ 30W. Probably it was due to the fact that close to 100 apps were being downloaded while it was charging. I will check the charging performance over the next few weeks and update review if required.Performance: 9/10Gaming: Initial performance on gaming is very very good (Asphalt 9 Legends and Real Racing 3). Zero lag and super smooth rendering.  Bloons TD6 is a very resource hungry at lategame levels and the 6T McLaren  made short work of it.Display: The display is really mind-blowing. Video on Youtube and other streaming apps was super smooth and brilliant to look at. One cool feature is that you can pinch zoom the content to include / exclude the waterdrop notch for front camera.  Adaptive brightness is annoying at times and I had to turn it off while playing the racing games.Camera: Have not tested the Camera performance yet. Especially the 4K 60 FPS option. Will do it soon and update the review.Hope this helps!\\n\",\n",

Being a power user, high-graphics gamer, freelance graphic designer, developer, an entrepreneur & a multi tasker, I find OnePlus 6T (OxygenOS) so much worth the purchase. Specially so when I am transitioning from MI Note 4 (MIUI). OnePlus 6T is an incremental upgrade to the OnePlus 6T with subtle but significant upgrades. But there is always something positive and negative about a device so following is what I feel about it:• The fingerprint scanner that was the key selling point for OnePlus 6T isnt as impressive as it seemed to be earlier before using the phone for a week. It is good but it isnt as fast as face recognition or back side fingerprint scanner. The major cause of this is that the back side fingerprint scanner in the previous model 6 was a definite point that was locatable but in 6T this area is on the screen and you need to tap the screen to get the area of fingerprint scanner to show and then you have to do the needful. This is like a step extra versus the previous models quick screen unlock with same level of security. This is a 2 second wasted only to unlock the screen.• The sound quality and camera quality is exceptionally awesome. No flaws in them for this level of pricing. There are few so called better ones in other brands but then better is a debatable word with camera output quality.• Storage / model options: I have seen the mirror version of version 6 with my friend and the midnight black that I have been using of version 6. Midnight black is just so so buttery smooth to enjoy and feel while using the phone that makes it seem like everything is on screen surface and covering the full screen area. Mirror version becomes boring and frustrating after a point because of the fingerprints that are left visible all over the back side of the body so easily everytime.• In-display fingerprint scanner / sensor: OnePlus’s dedicated fingerprint scanner has always been a secure and fastest scanner around. With in-display scanner they have integrated the fingerprint scanner inside the device remarkably well. It is fast enough to call it quick but sure isn’t as fast as dedicated scanner module which it implemented in OnePlus 6’s rear.• Blazing fast: There is nothing more pleasing that having a fluid experience using a phone and OnePlus 6T is blazing fast. Multi-tasking is such a breeze with 6T. Test it with almost any (and virtually as many) apps and 1+ 6T will deliver! Gaming Mode just adds to this beefy specs while you are gaming.• Gestures: After using it once and I dont want to go back to using buttons (almost definitely). The gestures add so much to its intuitive, smooth user experience, while getting work done faster and without any hassle.• Camera: I make some videos of indoor interviews often night light as well and some casual street photography. This 6T camera delivers to the price. Infact more, it is such an ease taking low-light photos without having to worry about setting up a light or finding a good light source.• Audio: The audio in this phone is aptly loud and with nice bass that a mobile phone can pack. OnePlus 6 had a very shrieky noisy sort of high-volume issue. But this one has a much more crisp and clearer stereo like speaker feel.• Faster charging: As always OnePlus is much loved for its fast charging and adding ~400 mAh to the battery 6T makes it all much more pleasing.• Larger & stronger display: The display is now Corning Gorilla Glass 6 sized at 6.41” which is just as much wide as OnePlus 6’s Corning GG 5 sized at 6.28” but with more height-giving aspect ratio of 19.5:9 aspect ratio and believe me watching movies, YouTube is such a bliss!!!• Just a Notch: It’s a huge improvement over OnePlus 6’s slab shaped huge notch. The notch in 6T is tear drop shaped and well designed, sized. It rather makes the appearance of the screen very attractive  It improves the overall usability and feel of display by many folds.• 3.5mm Audio jack is Gone: USB Type-C is all you need to charge the phone or listen to music. You need a type-C to 3.5mm audio jack/adapter within the package though which comes as a huge relief incase I am stuck with using an ordinary 3.5mm Headphones.• If you are a One Plus 6 owner you would like this thing about the charger that it is of same specifications in terms of electric input and output. You can use the same charger for both the phones. This saves you from the hassle of storing two chargers for two same brand phones.• 3700 mAh: Beefed up the battery (maybe that’s why the audio jack had to go). But this also means longer charging time with the same charger as OnePlus 6 but that is okay i think since it still is fast compared to other phones. Lot of people are crying for wireless charging. I guess they dont know about the slow charging speed and longer charging time for the smartphones. Everyone who has used the fast charger knows that wireless charging is not as great as it sounds.•  The software feature of Screen Brightness is a big dislike. Since the new OS update, OP6 and OP6T both have had very bad transition scale in terms of screen brightness. Earlier the screen was enough bright at 30% thus saving batter, but now even indoor use requires screen brightness to be set at 60% to be able to use phone properly. This is a big let down as it consumes a lot of battery.• The new software update has some improvements in Camera and gestures and some patch fixes. This is good, especially the nightscape camera features takes amazing low light contrast pictures (one nightscape mode shot pictures has been attached).• But the new swipe gesture addition to switch between previous and next apps has caused the previously existent two gestures for going to the tray and going back has become way slower and sometimes non responsive. In an effort to add something just not required, the previous smooth gestures transitions has been sacrificed. This is just wasnt called for.\\n\",\n",
